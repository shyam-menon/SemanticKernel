## Current Implementation Step

Implementation complete! The NRD issue resolution system has been fully implemented with the following components:

1. **Core Classes**:

   - DeviceState: Tracks device status and credential information
   - NRDAgentsOrchestrator: Coordinates the agents and handles the resolution process

2. **Mock Services**:
   - JamCPlugin: Simulates the JamC device management system
   - SplunkPlugin: Simulates the Splunk log service
   - CredentialPlugin: Simulates credential management functions

3. **Agents**:
   - MonitoringAgent: Detects NRD events and retrieves logs
   - DiagnosticAgent: Analyzes root causes of NRD issues
   - RemediationAgent: Executes recommended fixes
   - KnowledgebaseAgent: Provides documentation and best practices

4. **Orchestration**:
   - Agent selection strategy based on message content
   - Termination strategy with completion criteria
   - Main handler for NRD issue resolution

## Latest Updates

- 2025-05-12: Initialized project and created implementation plan
- 2025-05-12: Implemented core classes and state management
- 2025-05-12: Created mock plugins for JamC, Splunk, and credential management
- 2025-05-12: Implemented all agents with specific instructions
- 2025-05-12: Created orchestration logic and main handler
- 2025-05-12: Added test cases and logging

## Next Steps

1. **Testing**: Run the application and test with various device scenarios
2. **Refinement**: Adjust agent instructions based on test results
3. **Documentation**: Create comprehensive documentation for the system
4. **Enhancement**: Implement full simulation mode without requiring Azure OpenAI credentials
5. **Integration**: Connect to real systems instead of mock plugins when ready for production
